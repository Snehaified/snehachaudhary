### Projects
In-Silico Detection and Segmentation of Brain Tumors Using Deep Learning and Image Processing

ðŸ§  **Impact**: Early and cost-effective detection of brain tumors, potentially saving lives.
ðŸ›   **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, CNNs, Image Processing

- Developed an AI-based system to detect and localize brain tumors from MRI scans using Deep Learning.
- Applied CLAHE and filtering techniques to enhance MRI images before classification.
- Built a segmentation model to highlight tumors at the pixel level, improving diagnostic accuracy.
- Enables early tumor detection, reducing cancer diagnosis costs.
