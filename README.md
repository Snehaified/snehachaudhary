### Projects
In-Silico Detection and Segmentation of Brain Tumors Using Deep Learning and Image Processing
- Developed an efficient in-silico approach for detecting and localizing brain tumors from MRI scans using Deep Learning and Image Processing techniques. Enhanced MRI images using CLAHE and filtering methods before passing them to a deep learning classifier to identify tumor presence. Implemented a segmentation model to highlight tumor regions at a pixel level, improving diagnostic accuracy. This solution aims to reduce cancer diagnosis costs and enable early tumor detection, potentially saving lives.
